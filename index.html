      <p>Cara Nixon is a reporter and graduate journalism student currently living in Berkeley, Calif. She graduated in June 2022 with an honors bachelor's degree in political science and applied journalism from Oregon State University and has four years of print journalism experience. She now attends University of California, Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism and works with Richmond Confidential and the Investigative Reporting Program's Aging in America project. Prior to coming to California, Nixon worked in both reporter and editor positions at local Corvallis, Ore. newspapers, The Corvallis Advocate and The Daily Barometer. At those publications, she produced hundreds of stories ranging in topic from homelessness and a scandal involving OSU's president to community events and arts and entertainment. While at OSU, she also participated in a photojournalism internship with Chris Johns, former editor-in-chief of National Geographic—an experience which birthed a year-long documentary project about a local homeless man and his daughter. Nixon's main journalistic passions are covering education and issues which affect low-income communities. She is expected to graduate from Berkeley Journalism in May 2024. </p>
